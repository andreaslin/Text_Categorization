# Text Categorisation â€“ Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Model

* Categorised words to different labels using decision tree and naive Bayes Model under C++
* Compared different parameters used to build the tree and the accuracy graphically using MATLAB
* Challenged to increase the accuracy by adding the word dependencies to the parameters and
changing the splitting parameters
